It's a sunny day, I've got my shoes tied tight.
Heading out the door, everything feels right.
Walking down the road, with a skip in my stride.
Feeling in my soul, I've got nothing to hide.
In the sunlight, everything's in view.
Under the clear blue, all is good and true.
Walking on this day so sunny.
Life is sweet, like golden honey.
Streets are filled with laughter, joy is in the air.
Sunlight on my face, wind blowing through my hair.
Walking through the crowd, I see faces glow.
In this sunny place, love continues to grow.
In the sunlight, everything's in view.
Under the clear blue, all is good and true.
Walking on this day so sunny.
Life is sweet, like golden honey.
Walking through the sunshine, walking through the light.
Everything is perfect, everything feels right.
All is good, all is fine.
In this sunny place, I'm feeling divine.
In the sunlight, everything's in view.
Under the clear blue, all is good and true.
Walking on this day so sunny.
Life is sweet, like golden honey.
As the sun sets, and the day is almost done.
Walking back home, I feel like I've won.
For in this sunny day, what I've understood.
Life's a beautiful journey, and all is good.

alive and so am I

Feeling on top of the world, high in the sky. 
Blissful vibes, they fill my heart.
And all I want to do is start. 
To a journey of joy and peace. 
Where all is love, all never cease.
